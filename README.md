# ath_dsp

This library contains classes and routines for audio synthesis and signal processing, including DSP algorithms and mechanisms for controlling signal flow and application architecture. It is designed to be self-sufficient and independent of external frameworks such as JUCE, enabling use in projects built on alternative frameworks as well as on embedded platforms.
